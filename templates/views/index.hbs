		<p>Hello,</p>
		<p>We are Will and Alex and we founded Students4Students in 2015 after we heard that 1.2 million children are going to leave primary school unable to read by 2020. Unfortunately this is not just confined to English many children face the same problem inMaths too. What is particularly worrying is that if a child does not reach their potential in primary school then it is unlikely they will catch up what they have lost when they get to secondary school. To compound this many of the other subjects such as History, Geography and Science rely upon the core skills that many pupils will lack. This means that by 2020 there will be close to a million children and young people missing out on opportunities because they did not fulfil their potential in primary school.</p>
		<p>We see Students4Students as part of the solution to this problem. We believe that all children should be given an equal opportunity to achieve and learn in life and believe that Students4Students can help create this equality. The one-to-one tutoring that we provide ensures the child gets tailored help. Having tutored ourselves and seen other sessions being conducted it is clear that the benefit of tutoring goes far beyond simply improving core skills. We have seen how the children we work with not only become more confident theyalso begin to enjoy learning more.</p>
		<p>Students4Students is there to make a difference to these children's lives. We hope that you will support us as we grow the charity and work with more children.</p>
