Along with Alex, I am constantly engaged in furthering the growth of Students4Students, looking to expand to London and Bristol in the coming months. I would love one day for the charity to have an influence in Ghana where I volunteered with Alex this summer. One core focus of my degree is development on an international scale, with Students4Students we have scaled this down to a local level, developing young children\'s potential and achievement. I\'m an avid football player, and cyclist, with a passion for piano who constantly strives to seek out new challenges. An upcoming challenge of mine is a summer triathlon to raise money for Students4Students, which I am currently preparing for.</p>' },

Back in the early \'90\'s I was fortunate enough to work closely with Galina Dolya, one of the world\'s leading authorities on Yygotskan education. With Galina acting as my mentor, I was able to provide a vygotskan approach to the classes I taught in the arts, emotional intelligence, spatial awareness and logic. I taught in her schools in London and Hertfordshire. Working with Dolya provided the theory to my intuitive understanding of an holistic, child centred approach to education. It was here that I was was introduced to The Theory of Constraints (TOC).</p><p>In 2010, I completed a year\'s formal research into my original TOC programme that combined TOC with story to develop student\'s conflict resolution skills and enhance the abilities of students to make good choices. This ensured a distinction for my Masters in Education and formed the basis for the book, Storytelling for Better Behaviour. in 2014 I became an author for the Royal Society for Public Health and have written their Mental Health and Well being course for adults and have been a contributing author for the shorter course aimed at Youth Health Champions.</p>' },
